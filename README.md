### Assessment details    

Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.   
Rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.

The tasks to be carried out in the Jupyter notebook are:


1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.  


## Contents of Repository   

1. Jupyter Notebook "Real World phenomenon".  

2. Victoria Stats csv file - research dataset for sport participants registered in Victoria, Australia in 2015 and in 2019, containing participation rates by age and sex.  

3. Data Folder - contains csv files of simulated dataset    

4. Images Folder - contains images used in jupyter notebook

## How to run the notebook

1. Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net/) if on Windows
3. After downloading the required software, in cmder change to the required directory. 
4. Type "jupyter lab" or "jupyter notebook".
5. Jupyter will open in your web browser as a new tab. 
6. Keep the command prompt window open as it needs to stay open/running while Jupyter is active.
7. Select the jupyter notebook you wish to run.
8. Once in the notebook, on the menu bar select Kernel and then click on the "Restart and run all" option.
9. When you have finished, close or exit the tab in your browser.
10. Enter "Ctrl + C" in the command prompt to end the jupyter lab session.
  


## Packages used in the notebook

1. NumPy  
    Python library used for working with arrays, including a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays  

2. Matplotlib  
    Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python  

3. Seaborn  
    Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
    
4. Pandas   
    Programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel. Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting.

5. Datetime    
    The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times
